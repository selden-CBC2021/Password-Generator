# Password-Generator
## Description
- For this repository I was tasked with creating a password generator that enabled a user to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected through a series of prompts. Criteria included length of password, usage of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or symbols. The user needed to select at least one character type and the length needed to be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. Once this criteria was met then a password was generated in the text area.
- I learned that there is still a lot I need to learn with regards to functions and setting up variables that require user input. I thought I kind of had the hang of it in class but this was much harder than I thought. The hardest part for me is the logic that goes into the functions and how to break down my thoughts into small steps the computer can handle.
## Usage
- Start by clicking the Generate Password button and entering a length between 8 and 128 characters. Then confirm which character types you want your password to include, if you select none you will have to try again until at least one character type is selected.

## Credits
- I watched a few Youtube videos on how to create a password generator with javascript but many of them were without prompts. I got some general logic and some strategies from these videos.

- Finally I combined what I learned from those videos with help from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ and https://www.w3schools.com/ and looking through code from various users on github with how to handle the userinput values/boolean and made an object with keys that took in the user input.
